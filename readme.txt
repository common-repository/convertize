Increase your conversion rate with A/B testing for Wordpress websites.

== DESCRIPTION ==

Convertize is the conversion optimization and A/B testing tool that anyone can use to optimize web content and increase conversions. It is the easy way to run A/B tests on your WordPress website. 

The Convertize plugin allows you to create different versions of your webpages, editing your text, images, and buttons without touching a line of code. You set your own goals (by tracking buttons or URLs) and Convertize shows you which version of your webpage performs best.

== EDIT YOUR CONTENT AND A/B TEST NEW IDEAS, INSTANTLY ==

Once you have added the [A/B testing plugin](https://www.convertize.com/ab-testing/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=plugin-listing) to your Wordpress site, you can manage your tests directly from the Convertize app. 

* The [SmartEditor™](https://www.convertize.com/webpage-optimization/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=plugin-listing) makes it easy to adjust your content, so anyone can create a new test. You simply highlight the element you want to change and add new text, images or design. 
* SmartPlugins™ give you a quick and easy way to add geolocation, dynamic text and notifications to your site. That means you can [personalize your content](https://www.convertize.com/products/personalisation.php?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=plugin-listing) and target the right audiences.
* Because Convertize uses a [lighter Pixel](https://www.convertize.com/ab-testing-software/flicker-effect/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=plugin-listing) than alternative A/B testing tools, your pages load up to 13X faster than the benchmark.

Using the Convertize plugin allows you to experiment with different text, buttons, images, and design, without relying on a web developer.

== GET CLEAR RESULTS, FAST ==

Convertize gives you total access to your test results, with day-by-day statistics for Conversion Rate and page visits. The Hybrid Statistics Engine™ helps you find a winner faster than other tools and the Autopilot™ adjusts your traffic to maximise conversions whilst you test.

* During a test, the [Autopilot™](https://www.convertize.com/ab-testing-software/multi-armed-bandit/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=plugin-listing) handles your traffic, sending more visitors to your best-performing pages. That way, you never miss a conversion and you can optimize your website with complete peace of mind.
* The [Hybrid Statistics Engine™](https://www.convertize.com/ab-testing-software/statistical-significance/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=plugin-listing) combines two different kinds of A/B testing statistics to reduce errors and deliver faster results.

== FAQ ==

= What Is An A/B Testing Tool For? =

A/B testing compares two versions of the same webpage (A and B). Your traffic is divided between A and B, and their conversion rate is measured. 

An A/B testing tool like Convertize manages both pages, helps you edit page B, and keeps a record of your visitors’ behaviour. It allows you to increase your conversions, get more sales and sign-ups and reduce your bounce rate.

Because you gather real data about how visitors interact with your content, you can systematically optimize your website page by page. Convertize makes Wordpress A/B testing easier (and faster) than other tools, which is why it is a popular VWO alternative and a great alternative to AB Tasty or Optimizely.

= Is Installation Difficult? =
Installation is very easy. 

To start A/B testing your Wordpress website, first add the Convertize plugin. Then, [register for a Convertize account](https://app.convertize.io/auth/login/register?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=plugin-listing). Once you have registered, you will receive the code needed to activate your Convertize plugin.

With the Plugin activated, you are able to edit pages, run tests and install notifications immediately.

= How Do I Track The Results? =
Convertize will track every visit to your site, sending some visitors to page A and some to page B. The number directed to each version will change depending on which page performs best. That way, you never waste any of your traffic.
 
The results page shows you which page converted best for every day that your A/B test is running.

= What if I make a Mistake? =
Don’t worry! Convertize includes an in-built checklist to make sure your test works. It has a number of additional safety features. Because the system responds immediately to your visitors’ behaviour, the best-performing page receives the majority of your traffic. Even if your test scenario is less popular than the original page, you won’t lose out on conversions.
